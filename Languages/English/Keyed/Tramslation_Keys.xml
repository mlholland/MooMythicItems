  <!--In legacy stories, the following variables always apply to the following features

    3 = normal item label

  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_1>It's said that {0} of {2}, the original owner of this {3}, killed over 100 people. That seems farfetched, but it's undeniable that this weapon has seen untold battles. No one can fully clean off all the blood stains, and there's a palpable sense of menace emenating from the weapon. This {3} has seen more war than most people ever will.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_2>No one believed the stories about them, but this {3} is stark evidence of what the people of {2} were capable of. The name {1} is carved into the handle of this {3}, just barely legible beneath untold years of dirt and grime. </MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_2>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Melee_1>{0}'s Bloody {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Melee_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Melee_2>{0}'s Tally Marker</MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Melee_2>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_1>Perhaps {0}, the original wielder of this {3}, liked keeping track of things. Or perhaps they liked to show off. Either way, this weapon is etched with more tally marks than you can count. Hopefully you'll be able to add some more of your own.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_2>You've heard many stories about {1}, the headhunter of {2}. It's hard to believe the stories were true, but the bloodlust emenating from this {3} suggests that more than a few people died from this weapon's shots.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_2>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_1>{0}'s Skullpiercer</MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_1>

  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_3>{0}'s headhunting {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_3>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Shooting>The last owner of this {3} claimed that it had been in storage for decades, yet it's still in pristine condition. {0}, the mythical sharpshooter who wielded this weapon, must have taken good care of it. Perhaps that attention to detail is what earned them their reputation as the best shot of {2} and beyond.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Shooting>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Shooting>The Starsniper's {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Shooting>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Melee>There are old bedtime stories about "{1} the mighty", the greatest fighter who ever lived. Most people thought they were just that - stories - until this weapon showed up. If the engraving on this ancient {3} is to be believed, {2} were a real group of people, and {1} was a paragon of battle among their number.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Melee>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Melee>{0}'s Mighty {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Melee>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Construction>No matter how many times you empty out the pockets of this {3}, you always seem to find another nail, screw, or piece of wire. You aren't sure if it's magical, or if the master builder known as {0} just stuffed more random building scraps into this thing than you expected to be possible. Whatever the truth, this {3} has seen the rise of grand monuments.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Construction>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Construction>{1} of the Castle-Builder</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Construction>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Mining>The words "Who needs the sun?" are just barely legible on a faded patch on this {3}. Perhaps that philosophy drove {0} to become the best miner anyone has ever heard of. Supposedly the great halls of {2} were all dug out by {1}'s own hands.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Mining>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Mining>{0} The Tunneler's {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Mining>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Cooking>Some of your colonists find this {3} unnerving. Despite repeated washes, the smell of a tasty feast still clings to this clothing. This {3} supposedly belonged to the interstellar gourmet sensation known simply as {0}.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Cooking>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Cooking>{0}'s Smelly {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Cooking>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Plants>This {3} is covered in uncleanable dirt stains - a testament to the dedication of {1} the green-thumbed. It's said the people of {2} never went hungry thanks to {0}'s skill, and if the number of loose seeds still leaking out of the pockets of this {3} are any evidence, there's probably a kernel (heh) or truth to those tales.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Plants>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Plants>{1} of Green-Thumbed {0}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Plants>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Animals>DNA analysis has concluded that the fur stuck in this {3} originated from no less than a dozen different animal species. Perhaps the stories of {1} the great animal-whisperer were actually true after all.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Animals>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Animals>{1} of the Shepherd</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Animals>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Crafting>Just holding {0}'s old {3} makes your fingers twitch with the desire to make something, anything. Apparently the instincts of {1}, the greatest crafter from the fabled civilization of {2}, were passed into his gear.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Crafting>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Crafting>{0}'s Crafty {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Crafting>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Artistic>Some of the most expensive sculptures in interstellar history were made by {2}'s {1}. Most people thought this name was an alias, but the faded name painted on this {3} suggests otherwise. Just wearing {0}'s clothing seems to magically produce paint stains and marble dust everywhere, but it also instills a creative drive to meet the expectations you know {0} would have  </MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Artistic>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Artistic>The {0} of Elegance</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Artistic>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Medicine>This {3} was once worn by {1}, the grand surgeon of {2}. The countless tally marks on the {3}, originally thought to be kill-marks, are actually more likely to be lives saved (or maybe organs harvested).</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Medicine>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Medecine>The Bandaged {1} of {0}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Medecine>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Social>Everyone knows stories about the Bard of {2}. Supposedly they could pacify mechs with words, peacefully trade with cannibal tribes, and married into the High Stellarch's family. Perhaps {1}, the Bard's real name, exaggerated a few of those stories, but their charismatic energy still lingers to this {3}.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Social>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Social>{0}'s Shiny {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Social>
  
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Intellectual>{1} is a named that's rarely heard of nowadays. They're mentioned by cryptic archotechs when modern researchers try to uncover their original creators. Apparently their brilliance was unmmatched, and this {3} is perhaps the first evidence that they were a real person from the long-lost advanced people of {2}, and not just a story told among archotechs.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Intellectual>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Intellectual>{0}'s Curiosity</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Intellectual>

  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>Stories of {1} turn up in tribal folklore, where {0} is feared as a slayer of nature spirits. Depending on your view of thrumbos, that might be true.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Kills_Thrumbos_1>The Thrumbobane {1}</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Kills_Thrumbos_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Kills_Thrumbos_2>{0}'s Legendhunter</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Kills_Thrumbos_2>

  <!--In legacy stories, the following variables always apply to the following features
    0 = the original owner's full name
    1 = the original owners nickname, or first name if they don't have one
    2 = the original owner's faction
    3 = normal item label 
    For titles, only 2 inputs are given:
    0 = original owners nickname
    1 = normal item label

  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_1>It's said that {0} of {2}, the original owner of this {3}, killed over 100 people. That seems farfetched, but it's undeniable that this weapon has seen untold battles. No one can fully clean off all the blood stains, and there's a palpable sense of menace emenating from the weapon. This {3} has seen more war than most people ever will.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_2>No one believed the stories about them, but this {3} is stark evidence of what the people of {2} were capable of. The name {1} is carved into the handle of this {3}, just barely legible beneath untold years of dirt and grime. </MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Melee_2>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_1>Perhaps {0}, the original wielder of this {3}, liked keeping track of things. Or perhaps they liked to show off. Either way, this weapon is etched with more tally marks than you can count. Hopefully you'll be able to add some more of your own.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_1>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_2>You've heard many stories about {1}, the headhunter of {2}. It's hard to believe the stories were true, but the bloodlust emenating from this {3} suggests that more than a few people died from this weapon's shots.</MooLI_LegacyStory_100Kills_Ranged_2>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_1>{0}'s Skullpiercer</MooLI_LegacyTitle_100Kills_Ranged_1>

  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Shooting>The last owner of this {3} claimed that they've had it in storage for decades at least, yet it's still in pristine condition. {0}, the mythical sharpshooter who wielded this weapon, must have taken good care of it. Perhaps that attention to detail is what earned them their reputation as the best shot of {2} and beyond.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Shooting>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Melee>There are old bedtime stories about "{1} the mighty", the greatest fighter who ever lived. Most people thought they were just that - stories - until this weapon showed up. If the engraving on this ancient {3} is to be believed, {2} were a real group of people, and {1} was a paragon among their number.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Melee>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Construction>No matter how many times you empty out the pockets of this {3}, you always seem to find another nail, screw, or piece of wire. You aren't sure if it's magical, or if the master builder known as {0} just stuffed more random building scraps into this thing than you expected to be possible. Whatever the truth, this {3} has seen the rise of grand monuments.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Construction>
  <MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Construction>Castle-Raiser</MooLI_LegacyTitle_Mastery_Construction>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Plants>This {3} is covered in uncleanable dirt stains, a testament to the dedication of {1} the green-thumbed. It's said the people of {2} never went hungry thanks to {0}'s skill, and if the number of loose seeds that have survived in the pockets of this {3} are any evidence, there's probably a kernel (heh) or truth to those tales.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Plants>
  <MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Mining>Something something the first guy liked mining.</MooLI_LegacyStory_Mastery_Mining>

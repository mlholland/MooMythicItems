  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_1>It's said that the original owner of this {3}, killed over 100 people. That seems far-fetched, but it's undeniable that this artifact has seen untold battles. No one can fully clean off all the blood stains, and there's a palpable sense of menace emenating from the weapon. When wielding it, the name "{1}" comes to mind, along with thoughts of violence and conquest..</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_2>No one believed the stories about the bloodthirsty people of {2}, but this {3} is stark evidence they were capable of. The name {1} is carved into this {3}'s handle, just barely legible beneath untold years of dirt and grime. {1} was a champion of that long-forgotten faction, and their {3} still cleaves through pirates like doomsday launcher.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_2>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Melee_M1>How strong was {1}, the Butcher of {2}? No one is sure, because no one faced them and lived. The only truth you can find is in this {3}, which is weathered and chipped from hundreds of strikes. It clearly served its purpose well, and will likely continue to do so, should you have the strength to use it.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Melee_M1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Melee_M2>Many Rimworlders like to call themselves warriors, but few actually survive the brutal tests of time to earn that title. But this {3} once belonged to a true warrior named {0}. Myths claim that {1} ferociously defended the people of {2} and left legions of dead raiders in their wake. Hopefully their {3} will help you defend your colony as well.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Melee_M2>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_Melee_M1>The God of War, Corpse-Bringer, The Hound of {2}. These are just a few of the titles earned by the legendary killer named {0}. It's hard to believe that they were a real person, and even harder to believe that you somehow found their long-lost {3}. Picking it up, this {3} feels like a natural extension of your body. Clearly it's more than ready to continue drawing blood in {1}'s name.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_Melee_M1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_Melee_M2>The name "{1}" is a slang for bad luck among raiders, thanks to old folk tales about a monstrous person named {0}. They're said to have killed more raiders than should logically exist on any one rimworld. This old {3} fit the description of {1}'s long-lost weapon, so hopefully you can use it to start some new slang soon.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_Melee_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_1>This ancient {3} is etched with more tally marks than you can count. That's not too surprising, since {1} - the original wielder of this arnament - was said to have been a quite the show off. Now it's time for you to break their record.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_2>You've heard many tales about {1}, the headhunter of {2}. Everyone thought that the stories about them were just that - stories. But now, with {1}'s {3} rediscovered, people can't help but wonder if those tall tales were true. This weapon oozes bloodlust emenating, and people shudder to guess how many last moments were seen from the sights of this weapon.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_2>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Ranged_M1>People like to brag about having "{0}'s trigger finger", which is a reference to {1}, a storied sharpshooter of the Rim. This {3} actually belonged to him, and even though the rifling of the barrel is smooth from firing countless shots, it still aims flawlessly.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills2_Ranged_M1>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_RangedM1>{1}. Ready. Shoot. Pain.
Fall. Squeel. Flee. Blame.
{1}. Ready. Shoot. Dead.
Fall. Sleep. Bleed. Red.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_RangedM1>
<!--Breath. Again. Take. Aim.
Let. Loose. Lead. Rain.-->

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_RangedM2>Have you heard of the Ghost of {2}? Supposedly they were a sniper who claimed hundreds of lives across the Rim, ripping through pirate raids like tissue paper with their trusty {3}. How that artifact ended up here is anyone's guess, but it still tears through raiders as easily as ever.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills3_RangedM2>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Shooting_1>The last owner of this {3} claimed that it had been collecting dust in storage for decades, yet somehow it is still in pristine condition. According to legends, this {3} belonged to a peerless sharpshooter named {0}. They were said to have taken incredibly good care of their gear, so perhaps its supernatural cleanliness lends credence to those tales.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Shooting_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_1>There are old bedtime stories about "{1} the Mighty", the greatest fighter who ever lived. Most people thought they were just that - stories - until this {3} showed up. If the engraving on this ancient weapon is to be believed, {2} were a real group of people, and {1} was a paragon of battle among their number.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_M1>In a historic upset, the winner of the First Grand Imperial Gladiatorial Tournament was a Rimworlder named {0} from a faction of little renown called {2}. {1} swept through the tournament with their trusty {3} like a whirlwind. This is that same {3}. It must have been stolen from the museum where it had been on display, and somehow wound up back where it started on another Rimworld.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_M1>
  <!--, taking down royal guards, veteran capharact shock troppers, and grizzled pirates without breaking a sweat-->
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_1>No matter how many times you empty out the pockets of this {3}, you always seem to find another nail, screw, or loose piece of wire. You aren't sure if it's magical, or if the master architect known as {0} simply stuffed more random building scraps into this clothing than you thought possible.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_M2>Imperial nobles like to brag about owning homes with {1}-ial architecture, or furniture that is "built in the {2} style". These boasts hark back to the constructions of {0}, the greatest builder of the Rim. Based on geological analysis of lingering stone dust, this is actually {1}'s own {3}, and even today it still inspires people to build grand monuments.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_1>The words "Who needs the sun?" are legible on a faded patch on this {3}. Perhaps that philosophy drove {0} to become the best miner anyone has ever heard of. Supposedly enough steel to build a space ship was dug out by {1}'s own hands.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_M2>Beware fate of {2}. Led by {0}, the great tunneller of yore, they dug too deep, and lost sight of the stars. Heed not the the tempting whispers of this {3}, lest you too dig too deep.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Cooking_1>Some of your colonists find this {3} unnerving. Even after being washed a dozed times, a smell of corn still clings to this {3}. That's because this {3} supposedly belonged to the interstellar gourmet sensation known simply as {0}, who is rumored to have cooked more food than some people have ever eaten.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Cooking_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_1>This {3} is covered in mossy dirt stains - a testament to the dedication of "{1} the Green-Thumbed". Legends tell of the people of {2}, and how they never went hungry thanks to {0}'s skill. If all the loose seeds leaking out of this {3} are any clue, then there's a kernel of truth to those tales.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_M2>Legends claim that a lost city lies in the middle of the {1}-ian Jungle. Supposedly the jungle sprang up from the city itself, thanks to the tireless efforts of {0}, a botanist of extraordinary skill. The only artifact left of that city is this {3}, which smells like a lush plant growth.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_1>DNA analysis has confirmed that the fur, scales, and feathers embroidered into this {3} originated from no less than a dozen different animal species. Perhaps all the campfire tales about {1}, the greatest animal handler of the Rim, were true after all.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_M2>Old planet-hopping raiders like to spook new recruits with stories about the maniacs of {2}. Legions of animals defended their colonies, thanks to a peerless shepherd named {1} who tamed all manner of beasts. This ratty {3} seems related to those old stories, as there's a patch with the name {0} sewn onto it, and people who wear this {3} claim to feel unusualy calm around pets and other critters.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_1>Just holding {0}'s old {3} makes your fingers twitch with the desire to craft something. Apparently the instincts of {1}, the greatest tinker from the fabled civilization of {2}, have been passed into his gear.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_M2>Have you ever used gear made by {0}? Of course not. No one on the Rim can afford a real {1}-ian - their craftsmanship is legendary. That begs the question of how {1}'s own {3} ended up here. Hopefully no one comes looking for it.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_1>Some of the most expensive sculptures in interstellar history were made by {2}'s "{1}". Most people thought this name was an alias, but the faded, whimsically painted name on this {3} suggests otherwise. Just wearing {0}'s clothing seems to magically produce paint stains and marble dust everywhere, but it also instills a creative drive to meet the expectations you know {0} would have.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_M2>If you have to ask how much one {1}-ian statue costs, then you can't afford it. That's how impressive {1}'s reputation is as an artist. Known for touring glitterworlds and Imperial Fleets to showcase their masterpieces, {0} is a true success story of the Rim. Even today, their {3} continues to inspire new artists to reach for the stars.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Medicine_1>This {3} was once worn by {1}, the surgeon general of {2}. The countless tally marks on the {3} - originally asuumed to be counting kills - are now thought to be a count of lives saved (or possibly organs harvested, you never know around here).</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Medicine_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Social_1>Everyone has heard stories about the Bard of {2}. They could pacify mechs with words, peacefully trade with cannibal tribes, and married into the High Stellarch's family. Perhaps {1}, the Bard's real name, exaggerated a few of those stories themself. But there must have been at least a little truth to those tales, because their charismatic energy definitely still lingers in this {3}.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Social_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_1>{1} is a name that's rarely mentioned. Only Cryptic archotechs allude to them when discussing their original creators. {0}'s brilliance must have been unmmatched, and this {3} is the first evidence that they were a real person, and not just a archotech bedtime story.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M2>Many Rimworlders like to thank "{1} the Inventor" for the few conveniences that exist on the Rim. They're credited with inventing the auto-spork, among other things. You're inclined to believe those rumors, since this {3} has some old hand-written schematics for a prototypical auto-spork nestled in a pocket, and they're signed with {0}'s initials.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M2>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M3>Many Rimworlders like to thank "{1} the Inventor" for the few conveniences that exist on the Rim. They're credited with inventing the laser umbrella, among other things. You're inclined to believe those rumors, since this {3} has some old hand-written schematics for a prototypical laser umbrella nestled in a pocket, and they're signed with {0}'s initials.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M3>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M4>Many Rimworlders like to thank "{1} the Inventor" for the few conveniences that exist on the Rim. They're credited with inventing the shark-proof flak vest, among other things. You're inclined to believe those rumors, since this {3} contains some old hand-written schematics for the fish-proof flak vest (a precursor of the modern shark-proof flak vest), and they're signed with {0}'s initials.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M4>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M5>Many Rimworlders like to thank "{1} the Inventor" for the few conveniences that exist on the Rim. They're credited with inventing reuseable toothpaste, among other things. You're inclined to believe those rumors, since this {3} has some old hand-written schematics for double-use toothpaste nestled in a pocket, and it's signed with {0}'s initials.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_M5>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>Stories about {0} crop up in tribal folklore, where "{1} the Horn-Taker"  is feared as a slayer of nature spirits. Depending on your opinion of thrumbos, that might be true, as {0}'s ancient {3} is decorated with the weathered bones of no less than three adult thrumbos.</MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_M2>It's said that thrumbos avoid all settlements of {2}. It's easy to see why. This {3} used to belong to one of their champions - a hunter named {0}. Simply holding this {3} gives you an urge to go on a thurmbo hunt. You can only imagine how many of the creatures must have been felled by this weapon to inbue it with such energy.</MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_M2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_ThrumboFriend_1>Many tribes around the Rim worship a spirit called "{1}, friend of the wise". Myths about this character date back to the lost settlements of {2}, whose people supposedly knew how to befriend and even tame the majestic thrumbo. This plain-looking {3} seems to attract thrumbos, so perhaps the myths were true.</MooMF_MythicStory_ThrumboFriend_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicDescription_SpaceVictory_1>It is said that the people of {2} were one of the few Rim factions to have the grit, brains, and the metaphysical patience to build or find a spaceship and successfully get off a Rimworld. No one from their original planet knows where they went, but this {3} from {1} - one of the escapees - proves that they did eventually reach another planet. Perhaps it was this one in the distant past.</MooMF_MythicDescription_SpaceVictory_1>

  <MooMF_MythicDescription_RoyalVictory_M1>Life aboard the Imperial Flotilla is an existence of unparalleled extravagance and splendor. Of course, it's rare for any Rimworlder to earn such a life, and rarer still for their belongings to somehow end up back on another Rimworld. This {3} is the only known example of such an item. People think that it was misplaced by one a Regal Rimworlder named {0} after a wild night that storytellers call "The greatest autobong glitter-bender of all time". How did they lose it? That's for you to not know, and for {1} to probably not remember either.</MooMF_MythicDescription_RoyalVictory_M1>

  <MooMF_MythicDescription_ArchoVictory_M1>Some people consider this {3} to be evidence of the hubris of unfettered technology. Others call it a manifestation of the divine. Debates aside, it's clear that this object has been exposed to an unfathomable amount of psychic energy, which makes it difficult to look at for too long. Wearing it connects the user's mind to the echoes of a distant archotech that refers to itself as "{1} 2.0". This archotech offers all sort of advice, and also occasionally mentions a group of people known as {2}. Perhaps one of them was the original owner of this {3}.</MooMF_MythicDescription_ArchoVictory_M1>

  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_1>It's said that {0} of {2}, the original owner of this {3}, killed over 100 people. That seems farfetched, but it's undeniable that this weapon has seen untold battles. No one can fully clean off all the blood stains, and there's a palpable sense of menace emenating from the weapon. This {3} has seen more war than most people ever will.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_2>No one believed the stories about them, but this {3} is stark evidence of what the people of {2} were capable of. The name {1} is carved into the handle of this {3}, just barely legible beneath untold years of dirt and grime. </MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Melee_2>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_1>Perhaps {0}, the original wielder of this {3}, liked keeping track of things. Or perhaps they liked to show off. Either way, this weapon is etched with more tally marks than you can count. Hopefully you'll be able to add some more of your own.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_1>
  <MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_2>You've heard many stories about {1}, the headhunter of {2}. It's hard to believe the stories were true, but the bloodlust emenating from this {3} suggests that more than a few people died from this weapon's shots.</MooMF_MythicStory_HumanKills1_Ranged_2>
  
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Shooting_1>The last owner of this {3} claimed that it had been collecting dust in storage for decades, yet somehow it is still in pristine condition. {0}, the mythical sharpshooter who supposedly wielded this {3}, must have taken wonderful care of it.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Shooting_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_1>There are old bedtime stories about "{1} the Mighty", the greatest fighter who ever lived. Most people thought they were just that - stories - until this {3} showed up. If the engraving on this ancient weapon is to be believed, {2} were a real group of people, and {1} was a paragon of battle among their number.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Melee_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_1>No matter how many times you empty out the pockets of this {3}, you always seem to find another nail, screw, or piece of wire. You aren't sure if it's magical, or if the master builder known as {0} just stuffed more random building scraps into this thing than you thought possible. Whatever the truth, this {3} has seen the rise of grand monuments.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Construction_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_1>The words "Who needs the sun?" are just barely legible on a faded patch on this {3}. Perhaps that philosophy drove {0} to become the best miner anyone has ever heard of. Supposedly the great halls of {2} were all dug out by {1}'s own hands.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Mining_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Cooking_1>Some of your colonists find this {3} unnerving. Despite repeated washes, the smell of a tasty feast still clings to this clothing. This {3} supposedly belonged to the interstellar gourmet sensation known simply as {0}.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Cooking_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_1>This {3} is covered in mossy dirt stains - a testament to the dedication of {1} the green-thumbed. Legends tell of the people of {2}, who never went hungry thanks to {0}'s skill, and if the number of loose seeds leaking out of this {3} are any sign, then there's probably a kernel of truth to those tales.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Plants_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_1>DNA analysis has confirmed that the fur, scales, and feathers embroided into this {3} originated from no less than a dozen different animal species. Perhaps the stories of {1}, the greatest animal-whisperer of the Rim, were actually true after all.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Animals_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_1>Just holding {0}'s old {3} makes your fingers twitch with the desire to make something, anything. Apparently the instincts of {1}, the greatest crafter from the fabled civilization of {2}, were passed into his gear.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Crafting_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_1>Some of the most expensive sculptures in interstellar history were made by {2}'s {1}. Most people thought this name was an alias, but the faded whimsically name painted on this {3} suggests otherwise. Just wearing {0}'s clothing seems to magically produce paint stains and marble dust everywhere, but it also instills a creative drive to meet the expectations you know {0} would have.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Artistic_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Medicine_1>This {3} was once worn by {1}, the surgeon general of {2}. The countless tally marks on the {3}, originally thought to be kill-marks, are now known to be a count of lives saved (or maybe organs harvested).</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Medicine_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Social_1>Everyone knows stories about the Bard of {2}. They could pacify mechs with words, peacefully trade with cannibal tribes, and married into the High Stellarch's family. Perhaps {1}, the Bard's real name, exaggerated a few of those stories themself, but their charismatic energy definitely still lingers in this {3}.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Social_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_1>{1} is a name that's rarely spoken of nowadays. Cryptic archotechs allude to them when modern researchers try to uncover their original creators. One can only guess that their brilliance was unmmatched, and this {3} is the first evidence that they were a real person from the long-lost proto-Glitterworld people of {2}, and not just a archotech bedtime story.</MooMF_MythicStory_Mastery_Intellectual_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>Stories of {1} turn up in tribal folklore, where {0} is feared as a slayer of nature spirits. Depending on your view of thrumbos, that might be true, as his ancient {3} is decorated with the weathered bones of at least three differnt thrumbos.</MooMF_MythicStory_Kills_Thrumbos_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicStory_ThrumboFriend_1>Many tribes around the Rim worship someone known only as '{1}, friend of the wise'. Myths about this character go back to the lost settlements of {2}, whose people supposedly knew how to tame the majestic thrumbos. This thurmbofur-covered {3} seems to uphold those stories.</MooMF_MythicStory_ThrumboFriend_1>
  
  <MooMF_MythicDescription_SpaceVictory_1>It is said that the people of {2} were one of the few groups of people to have the grit, brains, and the metaphysical patience to build or find a spaceship and successfully get off a Rimworld. No one from their original planet knows where they went. This {3} from {1} = one of the escapees - prooves that they indeed reached another planet. Maybe it was this one in the distant past.</MooMF_MythicDescription_SpaceVictory_1>

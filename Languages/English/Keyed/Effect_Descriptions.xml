  <!--Effect description notes: 
   - these are added to the in-game description of mythic items, after the flavor string.
   - The element {0} should always be the label of the mythic item itself (ex: Revolver).
   - All other elements can vary depending on what subtype of mythic effect def uses these,
   although {1} should try to be the label of whatever is added to this weapon (ex a hediff, or ability label), if applicable. -->

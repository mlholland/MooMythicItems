  This def file shows how to create a new mythic effect.
  In this case, we'll be adding a new mythic effect where the holder of this mythic item gains a new ability. This will require adding two new defs into the game, and modifying one existing def:
  - Add a new AbilityDef that will be part of the mythic effect
  - Add a new MythicEffectDef that wraps the new ability into something that can be processed by the mythic framework.
  - Modify an existing MythicCauseDef to make use of this new MythicEffectDef.
  
The final point - adding the effect into a cause's options list - is actually done in the another example which adds values to existing cause defs. Check that out here: TODO

<Defs MayRequire="mooloh.mythicitems"> 
  <!--the 'MayRequire' ensures that these defs are only added if the mythic mod is present. This can also be achieve for all your patches at once using loadFolders.
  See https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Mod_folder_structure for more info.-->

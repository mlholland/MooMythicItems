<!--Difficulty: Easy/XML only.

  This patch shows how to add new effects, titles, and descriptions to existing MythicCauseDefs. In order for this to work, you must have the following 
prepared in other files:
 - for titles and descriptions, you must define trasnlation keys using the values you input here.
 - The effects you must define a MythicEffectDef of using the defName inputted here.
 
 Also remember: if you're editing a mythicCauseDef that has different options for melee weapons, those lists are called meleeEffects, meleeDescriptions, and meleeTitles. Ranged weapons
 use the original lists.

          and you'll need to match the subtype of the def you wish to change here. Once again, you'll see the sub-types defined in the opening tags of each MythicCauseDef in the folder linked above.-->
